In a railway reservation system, a particular bogey is allocated for women passengers. The bogey comprises 72 total seats. The first preference is given to female passengers whose age is greater than or equal to 65 years. Passenger can provide their choice of seats that include (i) Lower Berth (LB) (ii) Upper Berth (UB) (iii) Middle Berth (MB) (iv) Side Lower (SL) (v) Side Upper (SU). Write a java code that allocates seats to the passengers according to their requests. If the number of requests exceeds the total number of seats in the bogey, it should display the message that RESERVATION IS FULL.
